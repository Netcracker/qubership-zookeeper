This document describes the process of monitoring dashboards, their metrics and Prometheus alerts.

The dashboards provide the following parameters to configure at the top of the dashboard:

* Interval time for metric display
* Node name

For all graph panels, the mean metric value is used in the given interval. For all singlestat panels, the last metric value is used.
